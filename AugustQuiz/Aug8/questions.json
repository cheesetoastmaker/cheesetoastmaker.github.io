            "hint": "Pileus Clouds <br>They can be found amongst two cloud types: cumulonimbus and cumulus. Pileus cloud formations are created when the air surrounding a cumuliform tower is rising so quickly that it condenses into a smooth umbrella or hood like shape once it hits its dew point. Because pileus clouds are made from ice crystals, on the rare occasion you might see iridescence in the cloud, giving a rainbow-colored appearance. The formation of such clouds indicates that storms could be on the way. They are more often found above cumulus congestus and cumulonimbus calvus clouds, but on the rarer occasion can also be seen on smaller cumulus and cumulus mediocris clouds."

The promises of free distribution of non-essential commodities in an election manifesto amounts to electoral bribe under Section 123 of the RP Act. In response, the State of Tamil Nadu countered that promises of political parties do not constitute corrupt practice. The promises implemented by the party after forming the government is an obligation under the Directives Principles of State Policy. <br>Court’s Verdict <br>The court’s judgment held that promises by a political party cannot constitute a ‘corrupt practice’ on its part.It would be “misleading” to construe that all promises in the election manifesto would amount to corrupt practice."
